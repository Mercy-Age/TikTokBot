This TikTok can upload videos to TikTok, delete videos, subscribe to random post and download most pouplar videos from reddit

Requirements:
	First you will obviously need python, there is a requirements.txt file with all the libary you will need.

	You need to have chrome and chromedriver of the same version you can
	chromedriver need to be in C:\\chromedriver_win32\\chromedriver.exe but you can manually change the path in the code if you want.

	Finally you will need to open chrome and login to TikTok, unfortunately I didnt find a way to login automatically, but TikTok should remember you after you login once.

Warning:
	You cant run the bot and use chrome at the same time.
